# Emotion_Detection_App
This is a web application for emotion detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application is built with Flask and leverages both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and logistic regression models for emotion classification.

**Features**
Input Text: Users can input text into the application.

Emotion Prediction: The application predicts the emotion associated with the input text using NLP models.

Multiple Models: The app utilizes both LSTM and logistic regression models for robust emotion detection.

**Technologies Used**
1) Flask
2) Python
3) Natural Language Processing (NLP)
4) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
5) Logistic Regression

**Usage**

Clone the repository.

Install the required dependencies.

Run the Flask application (app.py).

Access the application through your web browser.

**How it Works**
The application preprocesses the input text using NLP techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and vectorization. Then, it feeds the preprocessed text into both LSTM and logistic regression models to predict the associated emotion.
